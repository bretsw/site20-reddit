### Teaching-related subreddits

--

Affinity spaces for teachers:

--

* Education in general (e.g., r/education)

--

* Education level (e.g., r/highereducation)

--

* Subject area (e.g., r/historyteachers, r/matheducation, r/MusicEd)

---

# r/Teachers

### High participation, teaching-related subreddit 

**https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/**

### How has the r/Teachers subreddit changed over time? 

We explored continuity and change across 3.5 years of activity in the r/Teachers subreddit in three dimensions: 
--

* individual contributions

--

* content interactions

--

* social interactions

```

### Data collection

--

* **r/Teachers** subreddit

--

* 3.5 years (42 months), from January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2019

--

* 696,660 contributions from 55,148 contributors

--

  * Total of 54,933 posts and 641,727 responses 

---

# Method

```{r, out.width = "240px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/reddit-logo.png")
```

### Data analysis

--

* Split data into 7 six-month partitions

--

* Then performed quantitative analysis of:

--

  * individual contributions

--

  * content interactions

--

  * social interactions

# Results

#Results

### Individual contributions

* slope of the **post** linear regression line: **0.03** (*p* < .001)
* slope of the **response** linear regression line: **0.49** (*p* < .001) 

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/contributions-over-time.png")
```

---

#Results

### Individual contributions

* overall numbers of subscribers, contributors, posters, and responders all trended upward
* recent growth in **observers** (i.e., lurkers)
* increased contributions from **super-users**

```{r, out.width = "840px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/table1.png")
```

---

#Results

### Content interactions

* response rate, responses per thread, words per post, and words per response all appeared to be fairly consistent
* mean voting scores for both posts and responses increased steadily

```{r, out.width = "840px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/table2.png")
```

---

#Results

### Social interactions

* the number of **nodes** (i.e., contributors) and **edges** (i.e., responses) grew
* node **degree** remained consistent
* **transitivity** decreased, meaning network connections became more evenly spread (i.e., less clustered)
* **reciprocity** increased, meaning fewer hierarchical relationships

```{r, out.width = "840px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/table3.png")
```

# Discussion

# Discussion

* r/Teachers has seen continuity, gradual change, and dramatic change by various measures

--

* as r/Teachers has grown, social interactions have become less clustered and more mutual

--

* teaching-related subreddits present various opportunities and challenges for novice teacher learning

--

* anonymity is a double-edged sword

--

  * opportunities for new teachers to engage in forms of identity play as they try on their new professional identities

--

  * comfortable space to process and ask questions without professional scrutiny

--

  * unknown sources of help mean needing to develop critical dispositions

```

--

* social media platforms continue to grow in popularity and potential utility for teachersâ€™ professional practice

--

* but, even with growth, there is evidence of both continuity and change over time, as measured by a variety of features

--

* more related work is needed!
